SECOND BINARY SEARCH TREE PROJECT

When one trees branches are much longer than the other branch then we consider it out of balance.
So we want to balance the tree. It only takes about 40 lines but they are tough lines of code. If you understand it though its not hard

To balance a tree you rotate it. You know when to rotate based on the BALANCE FACTOR. BALANCE FACTOR IS NOT HEIGHT BUT IT IS RELATED TO HEIGHT
BALANCE FACTOR = leftChild->height - rightChild->height
if they are both -1 the answer is 0
when BALANCE FACTOR IS -1 OR 1 its okay 
once we get a -2 we need to rotate left if we get a 2 we need to rotate right
Once you rotate remember to update height as well

Sometimes you need to do a double rotation. The key is knowing when to use which rotation
the four cases are 


when roots balance factor of -2
Either
	(right right CASE) so you	ROTATE LEFT
	-rotate left is done this way: 

	Node* cursor = root;
	Node* tmp = nullptr;
	assert(cursor != nullprt); //if this is false this will crash the program. Because this is bad
	tmp = cursor->right;
	assert(tmp != nullptr);
	cursor->right = tmp->left;	//if the leftChild of the new root has a left node we use this line of code
	tmp->left = cursor; 
	cursor->UpdateHeight();	//because techniqually cursor is still pointing to the old root which is now a child of the new root you start here to update it all properly
	tmp->UpdateHeight();	// now we update the new roots height
	return tmp; // then you where ever this function was called can now be equal to what we are returning which needs to be root

when returned cursor = RotateLeft(cursor);

when the roots right child has POSITIVE BALANCE FACTOR
	(right left CASE)		ROTATE RIGHT on ROOT->RIGHTchild then rotate left on root
	-done this way

		cursor-right = RotateRight(cursor->right);
		cursor = RotateLeft(cursor);


when root balance factor of 2
Either
	(left right CASE) when left child has a POSITIVE BALANCE FACTOR		
	done this way : rotate left on ROOT_LEFTchild then rotate right on root

	cursor->left = RotateLeft(cursor->left);
	cursor = RotateRight(cursor);

OR
	(left left) ROTATE RIGHT
	-rotate right is done this way (similar to rotate left, look at comments on that one to understand more)

	Node* cursor = root;
	Node* tmp = nullptr;
	assert(cursor != nullptr);
	tmp = cursor->left;
	assert(tmp != nullptr);
	cursor->left = tmp->right;
	tmp->right = cursor;
	cursor->UpdateHeight();
	tmp->UpdateHeight();
	return tmp;
		 
when returned cursor = RotateRight(cursor);
this is how we maintain BigO of logn

/////CODE\\\\\\\
So write a balance factor function!!!
Write a rotate function that checks your balance factor to know when to rotate
on rotate left it will have like 10 lines
rotate right is like 10 lines of code

Whereever in the program I updated height check if we we need to rebalance so that is only in remove and insert and 
remove isn't even tested.
